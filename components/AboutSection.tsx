            Founded by four students - Axel, Alex, Nils and Victor - 

UU AI Society was born from a shared vision to empower ambitious students to shape the future of AI technology from the very start of their academic journey. We believe that students, regardless of their background or field of study, have immense creative potential to drive innovation forward. Through collaborations with industry partners, researchers, and fellow student organizations, we strive to maximize our impact and explore the fascinating frontiers of AI. Our mission is to deliver carefully curated networking events, educational lectures, hands-on workshops, engaging hackathons, and student-led research projects - all designed to nurture the next generation of AI innovators.
